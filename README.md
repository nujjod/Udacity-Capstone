# Quora Duplicate Question Pairs Detection
Capstone project for Machine learning Nanodegree at Udacity

## Introduction
Quora is a popular website where people can ask and answer all kinds of questions. However, a lot of times people as similar or almost identical questions, which make searching for the best answer difficult. In this project, I have developed a supervised learning algorithm to detect duplicate questions on Quora.

## Dataset
Since the data was released in a Kaggle competition, the terms have to be accepted in order to get them. This is the link to the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs
The dataset has two files, train.csv and test.csv, and they have to be put in the same directory as this README.

## Required Libary
* numpy
* pandas
* wordcloud
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* collections
* keras

## Running
All the run scripts are in Quora-Duplicate-Question-Pairs-Detection.ipynb file.
